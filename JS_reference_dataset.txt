//Description:

// This code loads a feature collection called Drew_County_Reference_dataset 
// from the Earth Engine asset library. 

// The code then filters the feature collection to create two new feature collections: 
// Forest and Non_forest. The Forest feature collection contains all of the features 
// in the original feature collection with a Class value of 2, 
// which indicates that they are forest areas. The Non_forest feature collection contains
// all of the features in the original feature collection with a Class value of 1, 
// which indicates that they are non-forest areas.

// The code then prints the two new feature collections to the console. 
// Finally, the code adds the two feature collections to the map, 
// with the Forest feature collection colored green
// and the Non_forest feature collectioncolored yellow.
